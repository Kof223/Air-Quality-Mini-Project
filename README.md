# Air-Quality-Mini-Project

This is a mini project meant to teach myself a bit more on the IoT, html, and sensors.

## What it Does

The NodeMCU reads values from the sensors and outputs them to a webpage where I can access with my phone. It reads temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, CO2, TVOC.

In addition, there is an additional ability to turn an air purifier on and off wirelessly.

## Future Plans

I am planning to add some automation to turning on and off the air purifier. I'm also considering  connecting other home appliances just to do more IoT.
